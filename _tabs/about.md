- # Jianhao Song  宋建昊
- ### Hi there 👋！ Great to see you!

  - 🏫  I am a senior undergraduate student from Tsinghua University majoring in Computer Science and Technology.
  - 💻  I work on C / C++ / Python / Markdown.
- ### I'm a hacker, creator, and entrepreneur, inspired by "Hackers and Painters" by Y Combinator founder Paul Graham. Hacking, or developing, is the act of creating something new, much like painting. This analogy eventually became my guiding principle. My computer is like my paintbrush, I use it to "paint" my products, blogs and videos. Hacking is a way for me to express myself, connect, and resonate with others.
